## Business in China
Abundant Consumer Base and Talent Pool
With over 1.4 billion citizens, China stands as the world's most populous nation, surpassing the combined population of North America and Europe. This vast populace provides China with an immense talent pool but also fosters intense competition. Additionally, there is a significant domestic consumer market to cater to [3].

## Chinese Companies Take the Lead
Given the sheer size of the population, it is unsurprising that China boasts numerous innovative entrepreneurs. China is a dominant economic force with a multitude of domestic enterprises. However, foreign companies face challenges in establishing a foothold in China [1].

## China's Journey to Digital Dominance
Over the past few decades, China has transformed from an emerging economy into the world's second-largest economic power. Approximately two decades ago, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), leading to annual doubling of the nation's economic growth. Today, China is regarded as a digital pioneer, outpacing many countries, especially in domains such as Artificial Intelligence.

This article delves into the factors that have contributed to China's digital success. It begins by describing the characteristics of Chinese companies. Subsequently, it provides illustrative examples of platforms like WeChat and SHEIN, comparing them with Western counterparts. In the closing outlook, we explore how China, as a digital forerunner, will significantly shape the world [2].

## Challenges for Foreign Businesses in China
China is a challenging market for foreign entrepreneurs due to limited available business structures. Establishing an independent business is only possible when products are solely distributed within China and contribute to the country's economy. At some points, restrictions are even more stringent. For example, nearly all major Western social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are blocked in China [5].

## Government Support
China actively promotes the growth of its domestic enterprises to ensure their maximum success. The government achieves this by offering substantial support and acquiring already successful companies. In 2020, among the Forbes 500 most successful companies, there were approximately 120 Chinese and U.S. companies each. Nearly 80% of the Chinese companies were state-owned, whereas none of the U.S. companies had state ownership [6].

## Embracing Copying as a Norm
Kai Fu Lee, a Taiwanese expert in Artificial Intelligence, describes in his book "AI SuperPowers" that copying is a widely accepted practice in China. This principle is also evident in China's "first-to-file" patent system, where the first filer, whether the invention is self-developed or borrowed, is granted the patent [7].

## Data Privacy Takes a Back Seat
The Chinese government places less emphasis on data privacy, allowing companies substantial freedom in data collection and processing. Social media, both in private and public contexts, are under surveillance, and critical messages can lead to consequences.

## WeChat: A Multi-Functional Super App
Initially introduced in 2011 as a messaging service, WeChat has evolved to become a versatile app with over 1.26 billion active monthly users in 2021. By 2022, WeChat ranked sixth in the list of the largest social networks and messengers, surpassing Facebook Messenger and TikTok [9] [10]. The app offers features for chat, video calls, money transfer, online and offline payments, social sharing, and mini-programs, which provide an efficient way to use various services within WeChat [9] [11] [12]. Despite its functionality, WeChat is known to have minimal data privacy and is subject to government scrutiny, as opposed to some Western social media platforms.

## SHEIN: A Global Fashion Leader
SHEIN is the world's top fashion company, surpassing H&M and Nike, and operates one of the world's most visited websites [17]. It is often classified as a fast fashion company, characterized by rapidly changing trends, affordable prices, low quality, and increased consumerism [18]. Unlike traditional fashion brands, SHEIN focuses on frequent product releases, exclusive online sales, and robust online marketing, publishing over 7,000 products daily. SHEIN also engages with influencers and utilizes algorithms to quickly identify current fashion trends and collaborate with influencers for product promotion [19].

## Comparing Chinese and Western Companies
WeChat and SHEIN exemplify the disparities between Chinese and Western companies. Chinese companies, like WeChat, benefit from a large domestic market due to their massive population. In contrast, Western companies must expand into multiple markets to reach an equivalent user base. SHEIN demonstrates that Chinese companies can also excel internationally. Moreover, China's supportive environment and minimal regulations allow for considerable progress in the digital sector, enabling the creation of feature-rich mega-apps such as WeChat. Additionally, the rapid growth of data in China, driven by the absence of strict data privacy regulations, provides Chinese companies with a competitive edge. They leverage big data and data analytics methods to enhance their operations, making them more successful compared to their Western counterparts [21]. However, Western companies operating in China face the challenge of dealing with state surveillance over digital platforms.

## Conclusion
China's primary goal is to achieve national success. Chinese businesses encounter few financial and legal hurdles, allowing practices like copying, limited data privacy, and the unofficial motto of "develop first, then regulate." These practices are integral to the success of Chinese companies and make it challenging for Western counterparts to keep pace. As of today, China is already a digital trailblazer, and its policies and platforms are expected to exert even stronger influence on the West, both directly and indirectly. For instance, with the "China Standards 2035" initiative, China aims to establish global industry standards [24].
