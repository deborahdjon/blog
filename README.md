# Personal Website

## Description

Welcome to my personal website! This site is built using the react-like [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) library, a richly featured, open-source job scheduling library that can be integrated within virtually any Java application. I chose Quartz because it allows me to easily post blog posts using my Obsidian vault.

I've customized Quartz to suit my needs by:
- Adding a custom component for navigation
- Altering the colour scheme
- Adding animations using CSS and self-made illustrations
- Incorporating an interactive visualization of work experience placements

## Content

The website includes:
- A landing page
- A section showcasing the projects I've worked on
- An 'About' page
- My full CV

## Features

Key features of the website include:
- Full-text search capability
- Dark mode for easy viewing
- Browsing content through an interactive linked graph

Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
